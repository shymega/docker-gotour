docker-gotour
=============

## Status

This project is currently suspended. I've updated it as of August 2022 to keep it
up to date and to make the image smaller, and add GH Actiosn support

As of now however, this repository will be marked as archived.

## Usage

You can either run:

`docker pull shymega/docker-gotour`

to download the image from the Docker registry, or build the image
yourself by running;

`docker build -t gotour`

To run docker-gotour, just execute: `docker run -it gotour`.
